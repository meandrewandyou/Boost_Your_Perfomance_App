<h3>Early demo. Front-end only. Demo built-in user.</h3>
<h5>Just to demonstrate the idea of the app.</h5>
<h6>And the idea is to break anything you work on in working sessions. From small sessions
when you sick, feel down or have the lack of concentration but still have to work. To
large sessions when you feel inspired and pro-active.
Think about it as a school or university lessons. Work/break, work/break and so on. Yeah, the idea of this app is to help you work smart, not hard. Help you not to burn. This method helped me
while I was learning to code, was frustrated about my progress, was not able to figure out how this and that works. And I hope it will help somebody else. Just keep on going, step by step, no matter if it's small or big one.
I'm pretty sure there are a lot of similar methods, apps on the web, but this one is mine design)
The idea is to track all the goals you achieve, all the time you put in the work, and then
give you the visuals of that.</h6>
<p>P.S. I used just timer on my phone, pen and notebook) This app will combine this and many more)</p>
