<h3>Nearly MVP version.</h3>
<h5>The idea of the app:</h5>
<h6>The idea is to break anything you work on in working sessions. From small sessions
when you sick, feel down or have the lack of concentration but still have to work. To
large sessions when you feel inspired and pro-active.
Think about it as a school or university lessons. Work/break, work/break and so on. Yeah, the idea of this app is to help you work smart, not hard. Help you not to burn. This method helped me
while I was learning to code, was frustrated about my progress, was not able to figure out how this and that works. And I hope it will help somebody else. Just keep on going, step by step, no matter if it's small or big one.
I'm pretty sure there are a lot of similar methods, apps on the web, but this one is my own)
The idea is to track all the goals you achieve, all the time you put in the work, and then
give you the visuals of that.
The mechanics is: you add the project you'll be work on. No matter if it's some job project or you want to learn guitar. Then you add some goals. Then you start work session. Doing your thing, checking the goals. Then session ends. Reminds you to make the note about what you were working on during this session and where you have stopped. Then you'll not be able to start any new session before breake time comes to an end. And then you'll be able to see some statistics such as overall work time, pie chart with the sessions info and the number of completed goals during sessions of different amounts.
